## 2024-12-24 - Voices and road to Beta !
Now that I have a clear view of what is left to add to this mod,</br>
I can say that we are 1 or updates away from beta !</br>
I still need to add orders and configurable option with terminal, for now you can use lethal config for the client only configs.</br>
In beta I won't be adding new stuff (unless some exceptions) and it will be only bug fixing and mod compatibility.

Hope you will like this new update, there's a lot changed under the hood but unfortunately not so much to show...</br>
Expect for the voices of course !!</br>
A big thanks to **Mathew Kelly** and his incredible voice acting, there's more than 700 (!!) voice lines for those little guys.</br>
Chilling with you, following, founding loot, panicking, you name it, there's a voice line for every state of mind !</br>
You may know him as **Dragon-V0942** from [FurAffinity](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/dragon-v0942), and you can find some of his voice acting works on youtube [(Voice acting example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LGVz-ONeKE).

For now let's check what's changed !

## 0.19.0 [Alpha] - 2024-12-24 
### Added
- **Voices**</br>
More than 700 voice lines added for every state of the interns. Voices made by **Mathew Kelly**/**Dragon-V0942**</br>
The interns do not talk when a player is talking, and they tend to avoid talking while other interns talk (unless panicking, getting hurt, that kind of stuff).
</br>
After launching the game once you can find the audio folder in Your_profile_folder\BepInEx\plugins\Szumi57-LethalInternship\Szumi57-LethalInternship\Audio\Voices.</br>
From here you can find the voice folder named "Mathew_kelly" and inside, the voice lines organized by state (chilling, entering cruiser, running from monster).</br>
If you want to add you own voices, you will need to respect this tree. Add a new folder next to "Mathew_kelly" with the same sub folders hierarchy.</br>
But be aware if there is an update of this mod, the audio folder gets deleted, so keep a copy of you work (of course).</br>
But how do you link that folder to an intern ? That bring us to the next point :
- **Identities**</br>
The interns have now a name, a suit, a voice, and all that makes his identity.</br>
Identities can be found in a new config file at Your_profile_folder\BepInEx\config\LethalInternship\ConfigIdentitiesDefault.json</br>
If you want to make your own file, name it 'ConfigIdentitiesUser.json' and the default one will be ignored. Details can be found in the default json.</br>
To link the voice folder to the intern, simply change the "VoiceFolder" property in the identity you want.
- **New terminal page : Status**</br>
With this new way of working, interns can be tracked on your terminal with the keywork 'status' (while being in the 'lethalIntership program' page).</br>
You can see the list of all the interns and their status : name, hp, to dropped on moon, dead.</br>
You can buy specific interns by typing 'buy Mathew kelly' for example or quicker : 'bu math'.</br>
If they are dead, they can will be resurrected (only in while the ship is in orbit tho).</br>
If all identities are dead, buying more will make a default intern on the fly.
### More additions
- A spawn animation for interns, the dropship is pretty crammed so when the door opens... well I'll let you find out.
- New configs : volume multiplier, taklativeness, swear words
- New config : randomness of identities when buying them
- New config : maximum animated interns at once (see performance fixes below)
- Noise detection : they can hear you now and try to find you if they are lost while hearing you.
- New logo ! made by... **Mathew Kelly**/**Dragon-V0942** (can this guy ever stop ?)
- Compatibility with reviving mods : 'Revive company', 'Bunkbed revives' and 'Zaprillator', so many ways to revive those little guys.
### Changed
- The interns can follow you in the ship now, but not in orbit (next update maybe).
- Their whole movement got reworked (that took quite a while), they move like monsters now, following ai pathways, not falling in holes. No more ladder animation for the moment though sorry.
- Made the blob monster only doing 5 damage to interns, they are quite dumb when it comes to avoid him, so at least they don't die in 2 hits now.
### Fixed
- Performances fixes, found that the sound of their footstep what quite taxing on the framerate so I fixed that.</br>
Limit the number of animated interns too (see config), thanks @BetaSigmaOmega on Github, issue [#51](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/issues/51).

- Fixed compat with ImmortalSnail, they fear him now, thanks @AdamHarney on Github, issue [#57](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/issues/57).
- Fixed items dropped in ship not getting registred by the host.
