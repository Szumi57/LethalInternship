# Lethal Internship

Note from HR :
<br/>_As you may or may not know, our great company suffers from this staggering inflation, costs are rising, and budget cuts are on the way. 
<br/>But our dearest executives have found a solution to get the company back on track : 
<br/>
<br/>Interns !
<br/>
<br/>Willing to work, cheap and plentiful, these workers will support you and make your work faster and more efficient.
<br/>Don't worry, they're not intended to replace you.
<br/>So don't hesitate to make use of them and together become 
<br/>
<br/>Great assets to the company_

## Cheap Interns and where to find them

These passionate workers are available in a new section of your shop.
<br/>Buy them in space or on the moon and they will be delivered to you like regular items with the dropship.
<br/>
<br/>**They do not return to the ship**
<br/>In fact, they are not authorized to get too close to the ship and will drop the items near it,
<br/>you will then just need to pick up the objects and bring them back inside.
<br/>
<br/>**They always follow you**
<br/>Or at least try to follow you, or another player.
<br/>The moons are not very welcoming and the interns may have (some) difficulties to navigate smoothly in those tricky areas.
<br/>
<br/>**They are fragile**
<br/>But replaceable, less life points and can carry only one object at a time.
<br/>Be patient, they are learning, just like you not so long ago.

## How to use the mod
- A new entry should be present in your help page in the terminal :
![menu](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/menu.png?raw=true)
- To enter the menu, type 'LethalInternship program' or 'pro' or 'in', you should arrive to the info page.
![info_page](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/info_page.png?raw=true)
- From there you can buy intern with 'buy' command or 'buy nameOfIntern' if you know the name of the one you want.</br>
![buy4](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/buy4.png?raw=true) or
![buy_mathew](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/buy_mathew.png?raw=true)
- Type 'Status' to see check all of the available intern status.
![status_page](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/status_page.png?raw=true)
- You can revive intern by buying them specifically while in orbit.
- You can revive intern with other mods like 'Revive company', 'Bunkbed revives' and 'Zaprillator'</br>
</br>
While they are spawned, while pointing at them: </br>
- You can give them item with [G]
- Make them drop item with [G]
- Grab the intern with you [A], to go faster or useful on some map where the AI pathfind is not the best
- Change the suit of the intern by the one you're wearing with \[X]
- All input are configurable.

## Configuration files
Lots of configs are available for you, so go check them !</br>
Mod is compatible with InputUtils so you can change your inputs !</br>
There's also a config file for the identities of the interns (a name, a suit, a voice)</br>
![folder_config](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/folder_configs.png?raw=true)</br>
Identities can be found in a new config file at Your_profile_folder\BepInEx\config\LethalInternship\ConfigIdentitiesDefault.json</br>
If you want to make your own file, name it 'ConfigIdentitiesUser.json' and the default one will be ignored. Details can be found in the default json.</br>
![folder_config](https://github.com/Szumi57/LethalInternship/blob/master/Assets/Images/folder_config_user.png?raw=true)</br>
To link the voice folder to the intern, simply change the "VoiceFolder" property in the identity you want.

## Fully voices interns
A big thanks to **Mathew Kelly** and his incredible voice acting, there's more than 700 (!!) voice lines for those little guys.</br>
Chilling with you, following, founding loot, panicking, you name it, there's a voice line for every state of mind !</br>
You may know him as **Dragon-V0942** from [FurAffinity](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/dragon-v0942), and you can find some of his voice acting works on youtube [(Voice acting example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LGVz-ONeKE).
</br>
</br>
Some AI voices should be added next update (0.20.0)

## Have fun with cosmetic mods !
This mod is compatible with ModelReplacementAPI and all of its users (tooManySuits, MoreSuits, ThiccCompany, etc...).
It is also compatible with the emotes mod, emote in front of intern and they will copy your dance moves !

## On a more serious note
This mod is very alpha and I still need some polishing.
<br/>I'm just happy to share this project with you, in hope that you find it fun and enjoyable.

## Things to add
- Orders, a system to control the interns in some way. Can take some time to implement that too.

## Bug to fix
- Sand spider web trap not working for interns.
- Nutcracker ignoring interns.
- Compatibility with modded maps, for environmental hazards damages.
