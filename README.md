# Lethal Internship

Note from HR :
<br/>_As you may or may not know, our great company suffers from this staggering inflation, costs are rising, and budget cuts are on the way. 
<br/>But our dearest executives have found a solution to get the company back on track : 
<br/>
<br/>Interns !
<br/>
<br/>Willing to work, cheap and plentiful, these workers will support you and make your work faster and more efficient.
<br/>Don't worry, they're not intended to replace you.
<br/>So don't hesitate to make use of them and together become 
<br/>
<br/>Great assets to the company_

## Cheap Interns and where to find them
These passionate workers are available in a new section of your shop.
<br/>Buy them in space or on the moon and they will be delivered to you like regular items with the dropship.
<br/>
<br/>**They do not return to the ship**
<br/>In fact, they are not authorized to get too close to the ship and will drop the items near it,
<br/>you will then just need to pick up the objects and bring them back inside.
<br/>
<br/>**They always follow you**
<br/>Or at least try to follow you, or another player.
<br/>The moons are not very welcoming and the interns may have (some) difficulties to navigate smoothly in those tricky areas.
<br/>
<br/>**They are fragile**
<br/>But replaceable, less life points and can carry only one object at a time.
<br/>Be patient, they are learning, just like you not so long ago. 

## On a more serious note
This mod is very alpha and I still need to do a lot of polishing.
<br/>I'm just happy to share this project with you, in hope that you find it fun and enjoyable.

## Things to add
- Voice lines, I still need to figure out how to implement all of this and find someone or use AI.
- Make the intern go inside the ship. Will take some time, it is not easy at the moment.
- More suits and animations (using the other mods)
- Orders, a system to control the interns in some way. Can take some time to implement that too.

## Bug to fix
- Sand spider web trap not working for interns
- Nutcracker ignoring interns
- v60 stuff mineshaft elevator to fix
- Item in player hand disapearing when intern climb ladders -> conflit with mod BetterLadders
- Compatibility with mods 'Sehelitar's Zaprillator', 'bunkbedrevive'
- Compatibility with modded maps, for environmental hazards damages
- Intern not owned by player cannot take damage from said player
- Body of intern just disappears when shot by shotgun
- Only on march, with more than 6 interns, if they get close to the front door of the ship, massive framerate drop (why ???)
